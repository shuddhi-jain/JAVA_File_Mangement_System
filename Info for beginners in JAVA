1. Java Packages Used
java.io.*: Provides classes for system input and output through data streams, serialization, and file system access.

java.nio.file.*: Part of the New I/O (NIO) package, which provides a scalable I/O and file system framework.

java.text.SimpleDateFormat: A concrete class for formatting and parsing dates.

java.util.*: The wildcard import for utility classes.

2. Variables and Data Structures
baseDirectory (String): Stores the base directory for the file system.

fileSystem (Map<String, List<FileVersion>>): A map that associates filenames with a list of FileVersion objects, representing different versions of the file.

currentVersion (Map<String, Integer>): A map that associates filenames with the current version number.

versions (Map<String, Map<Integer, String>>): A map that associates filenames with a nested map. The inner map associates version numbers with file content.

FileVersion (inner class): Represents a version of a file with the following attributes:

content (String): The content of the file version.
versionNumber (int): The version number of the file version.
creationDate (Date): The creation date of the file version.
3. Functions and Methods
FileSystem(String baseDirectory) (Constructor): Initializes the FileSystem object with a base directory and creates necessary data structures.

getDetails(String fileName): Shows all versions with content and creation dates of a file.

createFile(String fileName, String content): Creates a file with user-defined content in a specified or present directory.

editFile(String fileName, String newContent): Edits the content of a file and creates a new version with updated content and date.

deleteFile(String fileName): Deletes a file and all its versions from the file system.

revertToVersion(String fileName, int versionNumber): Reverts a file to a specific version by replacing the current version with the selected version's content.

copyFile(String fileName, String newPath): Copies a file to a specified destination directory.

moveFile(String fileName, String newPath): Moves a file to a specified destination directory.

4. Understanding the Inner Class (FileVersion)
Represents a version of a file with content, version number, and creation date.

Used to create instances of versions in the fileSystem and versions maps.

Now, to learn about these packages, variables, data structures, and methods:

a. Java Input/Output (java.io.*) and java.nio.file.*
For file input/output, you can learn about classes like File, FileWriter, PrintWriter, and the java.nio.file package for more advanced file operations.
b. Date Formatting (java.text.SimpleDateFormat)
To understand date formatting and parsing, study the SimpleDateFormat class.
c. Maps (java.util.Map)
Learn about Java maps and their implementations, especially HashMap. Understand how key-value pairs work.
